# actix-web-static-files-bench

This project intended to test basic performance measurements for [actix-web-static-files](https://github.com/kilork/actix-web-static-files).

We have following sample set:

- application with Linux kernel v5.10.9
- flat set of 4k files


We intentionally keep versions fixed, because we do not need functions and just need size and object count.
